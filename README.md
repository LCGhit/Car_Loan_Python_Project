<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

Python car loan simulator program. Allows user to pick two cars he is interested in, and shows the breakdown of the monthly expenses associated with each, including loan payments.


<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview
This project scrapes data from websites in order to acquire information about cars fuel efficiency, estimated maintenance cost, and price. This data is then processed in order to compile the relevant information for each car (cars with missing data are discarded). Afterwards, some more information is requested to the user. Finally, an analysis is run, and a summary is presented to the user, with a suggestion of the most affordable of the options.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

- Assuming you are currently in the directory created for the project:
- Start off by creating a python environment: ```python3 -m venv venv```
- Activate the newly created environment: ```source venv/bin/activate```
- Install the Beautiful soup library: ```pip3 install beautifulsoup4```
- Install the requests library: ```pip3 install requests```
- You can now clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:LCGhit/Car_Loan_Python_Project.git```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can now call the program: ```python3 /directory/to/projectRoot/main.py```

[!Usage example: ](demo.cast)

1) pick a car from the list with which you are presented
2) pick a second car from the remaining options
3) give an estimate for how many kilometers you drive a week
4) indicate how much will be your downpayment (percentage)
5) indicate in how many months you expect to pay the loan
6) you are now presented with a breakdown of the expenses for each car, and the total monthly payments you would incur
